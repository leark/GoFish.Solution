## Description

The application allows 2 users to play Go Fish. Players recieve a hand of 5 cards and a deck is placed face down for players to draw from. Players should try to pair cards of the same suit and number by asking the other player. If player 2 does not have a match for player 1, player 1 will draw a card from the deck and their turn will end. If player 2 does have a match they give the card to player 1 and player one gets to go again. The winner is the player with the most pairs.
